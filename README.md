# checking-availability-of-username-live
So there are these files here. Just save them in your htdocs folder in xampp.
create a database and then a table and then just change the names accordingly in your code.
See the screenshots to understand better.
I have used jQuery, ajax and html.
It's a very simple and basic level project just to see the live working of availability of username.
You can add more features and make it better.

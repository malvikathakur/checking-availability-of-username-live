# checking-availability-of-username-live
So there are these files in 
# username_check
 folder.
 Just save them in your htdocs folder in xampp.
In PHPmyadmin, create a database and then a table and then just change the names accordingly in
# db_connection.php and username_check.
See the screenshots to understand better.
I have used jQuery, ajax and html.
It's a very simple and basic level project just to see the live working of availability of username.
You can add more features and make it better.
